This **guide** aims to gather knowledge about **bests development practices**, **software Craftsmanship**, ... and show how to apply them in a **Unity project**. 

The implementation of good practices aims to generate more easily maintainable and adaptable projects.  
If you have never used good development practices, you will need to learn and practice them to master them.  

This guide requires C# programming basics and knowledge of Unity software.  
  
⚠️ The practices presented in this guide are not unique solutions and do not always adapt to your project or your team. Some people can achieve better results by following their own methods acquired with their experience. My goal is not to impose a strict method for your projects, but to get you thinking about common issues and to give you theoretical and practical bases on solutions that I studied.
